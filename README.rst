This repository holds the code for **GlutenSense**, an open-source, microcontroller-based, portable instrument for easy gluten-free check of food samples, developed 
during my PhD.

The code is organzied in two directories: 

* **GlutenApp**, which contains the code for a PyQt5-based graphical user interface; for more information check the respective README 
  file and the `documentation <https://glutensense.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_;

* **PSoC_code**, which contains the firmware of the microcontroller (a PSoC-5LP was used).
