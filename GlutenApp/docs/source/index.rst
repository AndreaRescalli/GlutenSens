Welcome to GlutenApp's documentation!
=========================================
This page holds the documentation of the code for `GlutenApp <https://github.com/AndreaRescalli/GlutenSense/tree/master/GlutenApp>`_, 
a PyQt5-based graphical user interface specifically designed to work 
with `GlutenSense <https://github.com/AndreaRescalli/GlutenSense/tree/master/PSoC_code>`_, a microcontroller-based, 
portable instrument for easy gluten-free check of food samples developed during my PhD.
